<h1 class="heading jumptargets">Preface</h1>

<p>Software engineering has this in common with having children: the labor <em>before</em> the birth is painful and difficult, but the labor <em>after</em> the birth is where you actually spend most of your effort. Yet software engineering as a discipline spends much more time talking about the first period as opposed to the second, despite estimates that 40–90% of the total costs of a system are incurred after birth.<sup><a class="jumptarget" data-type="noteref" id="id-p8BuwtjFz-marker" href="#id-p8BuwtjFz">1</a></sup> The popular industry model that conceives of deployed, operational software as being “stabilized” in production, and therefore needing much less attention from software engineers, is wrong. Through this lens, then, we see that if software engineering tends to focus on designing and building software systems, there must be another discipline that focuses on the <em>whole</em> lifecycle of software objects, from inception, through deployment and operation, refinement, and eventual peaceful decommissioning. This discipline uses—and needs to use—a wide range of skills, but has separate concerns from other kinds of engineers. Today, our answer is the discipline Google calls Site Reliability Engineering.</p>

<p>So what exactly is Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)? We admit that it’s not a particularly clear name for what we do—pretty much every site reliability engineer at Google gets asked what exactly that is, and what they actually do, on a regular basis.</p>

<p>Unpacking the term a little, first and foremost, SREs are <em>engineers</em>. We apply the principles of computer science and engineering to the design and development of computing systems: generally, large distributed ones. Sometimes, our task is writing the software for those systems alongside our product development counterparts; sometimes, our task is building all the additional pieces those systems need, like backups or load balancing, ideally so they can be reused across systems; and sometimes, our task is figuring out how to apply existing solutions to new problems.</p>

<p>Next, we focus on system <em>reliability</em>. Ben Treynor Sloss, Google’s VP for 24/7 Operations, originator of the term SRE, claims that reliability is the most fundamental feature of any product: a system isn’t very useful if nobody can use it! Because reliability<sup><a class="jumptarget" data-type="noteref" id="id-gA2u2Iyh4-marker" href="#id-gA2u2Iyh4">2</a></sup> is so critical, SREs are focused on finding ways to improve the design and operation of systems to make them more scalable, more reliable, and more efficient. However, we expend effort in this direction only up to a point: when systems are “reliable enough,” we instead invest our efforts in adding features or building new products.<sup><a class="jumptarget" data-type="noteref" id="id-qpMuvtVhy-marker" href="#id-qpMuvtVhy">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Finally, SREs are focused on operating <em>services</em> built atop our distributed computing systems, whether those services are planet-scale storage, email for hundreds of millions of users, or where Google began, web search. The “site” in our name originally referred to SRE’s role in keeping the <em>google.com</em> website running, though we now run many more services, many of which aren’t themselves websites—from internal infrastructure such as Bigtable to products for external developers such as the Google Cloud Platform.</p>

<p>Although we have represented SRE as a broad discipline, it is no surprise that it arose in the fast-moving world of web services, and perhaps in origin owes something to the peculiarities of our infrastructure. It is equally no surprise that of all the post-deployment characteristics of software that we could choose to devote special attention to, reliability is the one we regard as primary.<sup><a class="jumptarget" data-type="noteref" id="id-qpMuAFAcy-marker" href="#id-qpMuAFAcy">4</a></sup> The domain of web services, both because the process of improving and changing server-side software is comparatively contained, and because managing change itself is so tightly coupled with failures of all kinds, is a natural platform from which our approach might emerge.</p>

<p>Despite arising at Google, and in the web community more generally, we think that this discipline has lessons applicable to other communities and other organizations. This book is an attempt to explain how we do things: both so that other organizations might make use of what we’ve learned, and so that we can better define the role and what the term means. To that end, we have organized the book so that general principles and more specific practices are separated where possible, and where it’s appropriate to discuss a particular topic with Google-specific information, we trust that the reader will indulge us in this and will not be afraid to draw useful conclusions about their own environment.</p>

<p class="pagebreak-before">We have also provided some orienting material—a description of Google’s production environment and a mapping between some of our internal software and publicly available software—which should help to contextualize what we are saying and make it more directly usable.</p>

<p>Ultimately, of course, more reliability-oriented software and systems engineering is inherently good. However, we acknowledge that smaller organizations may be wondering how they can best use the experience represented here: much like security, the earlier you care about reliability, the better. This implies that even though a small organization has many pressing concerns and the software choices you make may differ from those Google made, it’s still worth putting lightweight reliability support in place early on, because it’s less costly to expand a structure later on than it is to introduce one that is not present. <a data-type="xref" href="/sre-book/part-IV-management/">Management</a> contains a number of best practices for training, communication, and meetings that we’ve found to work well for us, many of which should be immediately usable by your organization.</p>

<p>But for sizes between a startup and a multinational, there probably already is someone in your organization who is doing SRE work, without it necessarily being called that name, or recognized as such. Another way to get started on the path to improving reliability for your organization is to formally recognize that work, or to find these people and foster what they do—reward it. They are people who stand on the cusp between one way of looking at the world and another one: like Newton, who is sometimes called not the world’s first physicist, but the world’s last alchemist.</p>

<p>And taking the historical view, who, then, looking back, might be the first SRE?</p>

<p>We like to think that Margaret Hamilton, working on the Apollo program on loan from MIT, had all of the significant traits of the first SRE.<sup><a class="jumptarget" data-type="noteref" id="id-na2u1SWHw-marker" href="#id-na2u1SWHw">5</a></sup> In her own words, "part of the culture was to learn from everyone and everything, including from that which one would least expect."</p>

<p>A case in point was when her young daughter Lauren came to work with her one day, while some of the team were running mission scenarios on the hybrid simulation computer. As young children do, Lauren went exploring, and she caused a "mission" to crash by selecting the DSKY keys in an unexpected way, alerting the team as to what would happen if the prelaunch program, P01, were inadvertently selected by a real astronaut during a real mission, during real midcourse. (Launching P01 inadvertently on a real mission would be a major problem, because it wipes out navigation data, and the computer was not equipped to pilot the craft with no navigation data.)</p>

<p class="pagebreak-before">With an SRE’s instincts, Margaret submitted a program change request to add special error checking code in the on­board flight software in case an astronaut should, by accident, happen to select P01 during flight. But this move was considered unnecessary by the "higher-ups" at NASA: of course, that could never happen! So instead of adding error checking code, Margaret updated the mission specifications documentation to say the equivalent of "Do not select P01 during flight." (Apparently the update was amusing to many on the project, who had been told many times that astronauts would not make any mistakes—after all, they were trained to be perfect.)</p>

<p>Well, Margaret’s suggested safeguard was only considered unnecessary until the very next mission, on Apollo 8, just days after the specifications update. During midcourse on the fourth day of flight with the astronauts Jim Lovell, William Anders, and Frank Borman on board, Jim Lovell selected P01 by mistake—as it happens, on Christmas Day—creating much havoc for all involved. This was a critical problem, because in the absence of a workaround, no navigation data meant the astronauts were never coming home. Thankfully, the documentation update had explicitly called this possibility out, and was invaluable in figuring out how to upload usable data and recover the mission, with not much time to spare.</p>

<p>As Margaret says, "a thorough understanding of how to operate the systems was not enough to prevent human errors," and the change request to add error detection and recovery software to the prelaunch program P01 was approved shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>Although the Apollo 8 incident occurred decades ago, there is much in the preceding paragraphs directly relevant to engineers’ lives today, and much that will continue to be directly relevant in the future. Accordingly, for the systems you look after, for the groups you work in, or for the organizations you’re building, please bear the SRE Way in mind: thoroughness and dedication, belief in the value of preparation and documentation, and an awareness of what could go wrong, coupled with a strong desire to prevent it. Welcome to our emerging profession!</p>

  <h5 class="heading jumptargets">How to Read This Book</h5>
  <p>This book is a series of essays written by members and alumni of Google’s Site Reliability Engineering organization. It’s much more like conference proceedings than it is like a standard book by an author or a small number of authors. Each chapter is intended to be read as a part of a coherent whole, but a good deal can be gained by reading on whatever subject particularly interests you. (If there are other articles that support or inform the text, we reference them so you can follow up accordingly.)</p>
  <p>You don’t need to read in any particular order, though we’d suggest at least starting with Chapters <a data-type="xref" href="/sre-book/production-environment/
" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber">The Production Environment at Google, from the Viewpoint of an SRE</a> and <a data-type="xref" href="/sre-book/embracing-risk/" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber">Embracing Risk</a>, which describe Google’s production environment and outline how SRE approaches risk, respectively. (Risk is, in many ways, the key quality of our profession.) Reading cover-to-cover is, of course, also useful and possible; our chapters are grouped thematically, into Principles (<a data-type="xref" href="/sre-book/part-II-principles/">Principles</a>), Practices (<a data-type="xref" href="/sre-book/part-III-practices/">Practices</a>), and Management (<a data-type="xref" href="/sre-book/part-IV-management/">Management</a>). Each has a small introduction that highlights what the individual pieces are about, and references other articles published by Google SREs, covering specific topics in more detail. Additionally, the companion website to this book, <a href="https://g.co/SREBook"><em class="hyperlink">https://g.co/SREBook</em></a>, has a number of helpful resources.</p>
  <p>We hope this will be at least as useful and interesting to you as putting it together was for us.</p>
